# Definition
Include all technologies and processes related to procesing data. Eg.:
   - **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence
   - **M**achine **L**earning
   - **I**nternet **T**echnology
   - Big Data
   - Cloud
   - Network
   - Programing
   - Provisioning

# Howto and where to start

## Introduction
- Before introducing the computer science, we must speak of **language** and **domain**
- **language** is associate to words like: communicate, sentence, statement
- The **domain** of computer sciences, like all domains, defines its own language. In this case: the computing language
- The computing language like some other languages
  1. extends or redefines semantic of some common language words (eg. *network*, *databse*, *provision*)
  1. defines words, terms, concepts and expressions that are not in the common language (eg. *file*, *folder*)
- By extending, redefining or creating new words, terms, concepts and expressions, the Computer language is led to
  1. redefine or extend some common language words that where not initially in its language (eg. *add* and *delete*)
  1. define new words, terms, concepts and expressions that where not initially in its language (eg. *xxx*, *yyy*, *zz*)

## Where to start

  - Os, Vm, network
  - file, folder
  - ram, rom
  - program, application
  - machine






# To know
Automation in IT (ie. computer science) is heavilly used to hide complexity. Complexity comes from the fact that resources:
  - have properties (e.g name, type, rule, ...)
  - can have a hierarchical representation
  - can communicate
  - have dependencies
