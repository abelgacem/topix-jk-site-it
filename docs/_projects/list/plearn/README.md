# {{ site.data.name.purpose }}
Create a platform that:
- Offers tutorials on various subjects and topics.
- Allows users to learn and practice in pre-configured environments.

# Platform Structure:

## Available Tutorials
- The platform offers a variety of tutorials covering different topics.
- Each tutorial is structured to guide the user step-by-step.

## Tutorial Content
- **Detailed Instructions:** 
  - Each step of the tutorial should include clear instructions on what the user needs to do.
- **Expected Outputs:** 
  - Examples of the expected outputs should be provided so that the user can verify their work.
- **Expected Code:** 
  - The expected code or scripts should be presented so that the user knows what is required.
- **Required Environments:**
  - Each tutorial should specify the environments needed for execution (e.g., specific software versions, libraries, or system configurations).

## Learning Environments
- The learning environments, or "development environments," should be pre-configured and ready to use.
- These environments include:
  - **Data:** Datasets required to run the tutorials.
  - **Tools:** Software, libraries, or frameworks needed to follow the tutorials.

# Additional Features to Consider:

- **Easy Access to Environments:**
  - Users should be able to access the environments easily without having to configure them themselves.

- **Progress Tracking:**
  - The platform could include a progress tracking feature so that users know where they are in their learning journey.

- **Assessment and Feedback:**
  - Quizzes or practical exercises could be added to assess users' understanding, with personalized feedback.
