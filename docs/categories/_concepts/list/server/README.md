# {{site.data.name.definition}}
- a **category of tool** designed to manage and respond to client requests.
- It listens for client requests on a specified **port**.
- Upon receiving a request, the server **reads** the request and triggers a corresponding **response**.
- The server **processes** the clientâ€™s request, performs necessary operations (e.g., retrieving data, executing functions), and **sends back** a response to the client.

# Definition of a Server
A server is a **category of tool** designed to manage and respond to client requests. It listens on a specific **port**, processes requests according to a protocol, and sends a **response** to the client. Servers can be categorized based on the type of protocol they handle and the services they enable.

# Categories of Servers

## 1. **Web Server**
- **Protocol**: HTTP/HTTPS
- **Examples**: Apache, Nginx, Microsoft IIS
- **Enables**: Serves static and dynamic web pages to clients (browsers), handling requests for resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. Web servers are the foundation of the World Wide Web, allowing users to browse websites.

## 2. **API Server**
- **Protocol**: REST, GraphQL, gRPC
- **Examples**: Express.js, Flask, FastAPI
- **Enables**: Facilitates communication between different software applications by providing a structured interface (API) for data exchange. API servers power web and mobile applications by connecting them to backend services.

## 3. **Database Server**
- **Protocol**: SQL, NoSQL, ODBC, JDBC
- **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle Database
- **Enables**: Stores, retrieves, and manages data. Database servers support both structured (SQL) and unstructured (NoSQL) data storage, providing the backbone for applications that need to persist user data, handle transactions, or perform complex queries.

## 4. **Application Server**
- **Protocol**: HTTP, WebSockets, RMI (Remote Method Invocation)
- **Examples**: JBoss, Tomcat, WebLogic
- **Enables**: Hosts business logic for applications, handling complex processing, transaction management, and communication between client requests and backend systems. Application servers power dynamic content and enterprise applications.

## 5. **File Server**
- **Protocol**: SMB, FTP, NFS, SFTP
- **Examples**: Samba, FileZilla Server, Windows File Server
- **Enables**: Centralized storage for files, enabling users and applications to store, retrieve, and share files over a network. File servers facilitate collaboration by providing access to shared documents and resources.

## 6. **Proxy Server**
- **Protocol**: HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS
- **Examples**: Squid, HAProxy, Nginx
- **Enables**: Acts as an intermediary between clients and other servers, providing services like load balancing, caching, and access control. Proxy servers improve performance, security, and scalability by reducing the direct interaction between clients and backend servers.

## 7. **Name Resolution Server**
- **Protocol**: DNS (Domain Name System)
- **Examples**: BIND, Microsoft DNS, Cloudflare DNS
- **Enables**: Converts human-readable domain names into IP addresses. DNS servers allow users to access websites and services using easy-to-remember domain names instead of numerical IP addresses.

## 8. **Authentication Server**
- **Protocol**: LDAP, Kerberos, OAuth, SAML
- **Examples**: FreeIPA, Okta, Active Directory
- **Enables**: Verifies user identities and manages secure access to resources. Authentication servers provide single sign-on (SSO) capabilities and enforce security policies for organizations.

## 9. **Media Streaming Server**
- **Protocol**: RTSP, HLS, RTP
- **Examples**: Wowza Streaming Engine, Red5, Plex
- **Enables**: Delivers audio and video content to clients in real time, ensuring smooth playback. Media streaming servers support online video platforms, live broadcasts, and on-demand video services.

## 10. **Virtualization Server**
- **Protocol**: Hypervisor protocols (e.g., KVM, VMware, Hyper-V)
- **Examples**: VMware ESXi, Proxmox, XenServer
- **Enables**: Provides virtualized computing environments, allowing multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical host. Virtualization servers enable resource optimization and support cloud computing environments.

## 11. **HTTP Server**
- **Protocol**: HTTP/HTTPS
- **Examples**: Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Caddy
- **Enables**: Serves static content, handles simple client-server interactions, and forwards dynamic requests to application servers. HTTP servers are often part of a larger stack, providing the gateway for web applications.

## 12. **Email Server**
- **Protocol**: SMTP, IMAP, POP3
- **Examples**: Postfix, Microsoft Exchange, Sendmail
- **Enables**: Manages the sending, receiving, and storage of email messages. Email servers support communication over the internet, ensuring reliable delivery and management of email between users.

## 13. **Game Server**
- **Protocol**: TCP/UDP, WebSockets
- **Examples**: Unity Server, Unreal Engine Server, Minecraft Server
- **Enables**: Manages multiplayer gaming sessions by synchronizing game state, handling player interactions, and ensuring real-time communication. Game servers allow multiple players to engage in the same virtual environment.

## 14. **Chat Server**
- **Protocol**: XMPP, IRC, WebSockets
- **Examples**: ejabberd, OpenFire, Slack, Discord
- **Enables**: Facilitates real-time messaging and communication between users or applications. Chat servers power messaging platforms, supporting features like user presence, group chats, and file sharing.

## 15. **VPN Server**
- **Protocol**: OpenVPN, IPSec, L2TP
- **Examples**: OpenVPN, WireGuard, SoftEther
- **Enables**: Provides secure access to remote networks by creating encrypted tunnels between client devices and the server. VPN servers allow users to access network resources securely from any location.

## 16. **Backup Server**
- **Protocol**: SMB, NFS, SFTP
- **Examples**: Bacula, Veeam, Amanda
- **Enables**: Manages backup operations by storing copies of data and ensuring data redundancy. Backup servers provide disaster recovery solutions by safeguarding data from loss.

## 17. **Print Server**
- **Protocol**: IPP, SMB, LPD
- **Examples**: CUPS, Windows Print Server
- **Enables**: Manages print requests from clients, providing centralized control over printers. Print servers enable users to send print jobs to network-connected printers without needing a direct connection.

## 18. **DNS Server**
- **Protocol**: DNS (Domain Name System)
- **Examples**: BIND, Cloudflare DNS, Google Public DNS
- **Enables**: Resolves domain names into IP addresses, allowing users to navigate the internet by easily-remembered domain names instead of numeric addresses.
