# Definition

- Allow to secure data

# Type
- symmetric  (uses symmetric algorithm) 
- asymmetric (uses asymmetric algorithm)

# symmetric encryption
- The encryption process and The decryption process uses the same key 
- faster than asymmetric encryption
  - so often used to crypt large amount of data
# asymmetric encryption
- uses 2 keys
- The public key is shared openly
- The private key is kept secret
- The encryption process uses the public key
- The decryption process uses the private key
- often used for
  - key exchange
  - digital signatures
  - establishing secure communication channels
- slower than asymmetric encryption
  - so not used to crypt large amount of data
