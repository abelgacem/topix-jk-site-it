# {{ site.data.name.definition }}
## Inteligence
a set of abilities:
- **Learn** new informations, knowledges, skills or understanding.
- **Adapt** the behaviour to a changing environment or context.
- **Solve** new problmems, **Adress** new situations and **Learn** from them.

## AI
- A domain in computer science
- The object of study is AI System

## AI System

Also know as **AI system** ({{ site.data.name.eg }} entity, computer, {{ site.data.name.vm }}, application) that 
  - Has intelligence abilities.
  - Mimics human intelligence
- Implement one or several AI models

# {{ site.data.name.class }}
The 2 **main categories** of IA: are:

|name|description|comment|
|-|-|-|
|General AI (AGI)|Aims to perform any intellectual task that a human can, with the ability to generalize knowledge.|Still theoretical|
|Specialized AI (Narrow AI)|Designed to perform a specific task or a set of narrow tasks with high efficiency.|Siri, facial recognition systems|

The **other categories** include:

|name|description|comment|
|-|-|-|
|Generative AI (GenAI)|Generates new data based on learned patterns from training data.|GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)|
|Discriminative AI|Classifies data by learning decision boundaries between different categories.|Logistic regression, Random forest decision trees, SVMs, Simple neural networks|
|Supervised Learning AI|Learns from labeled datasets to predict outputs for new data.|Image classification|
|Unsupervised Learning AI|Finds patterns and structures in unlabeled data without explicit outputs.|Clustering (e.g., k-means)|
|Reinforcement Learning AI|Learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards.|AlphaGo, robotics|
|Self-supervised Learning AI|Uses part of the data as labels, combining aspects of supervised and unsupervised learning.|GPT (pre-training language models)|
|Semi-supervised Learning AI|Combines small amounts of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data for learning.|Image recognition with limited labels|
|Transfer Learning AI|Adapts a model trained on one task to a different but related task.|Pre-trained neural networks|
|Evolutionary AI|Uses evolutionary algorithms to evolve solutions, inspired by natural selection.|Genetic algorithms|
|Symbolic AI (GOFAI)|Based on logic and predefined rules, focuses on knowledge representation and reasoning.|Expert systems|
|Hybrid AI|Combines multiple AI approaches to solve complex problems.|IBM Watson|
