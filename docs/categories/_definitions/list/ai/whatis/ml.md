# {{ site.data.name.definition }}

## Machine learning
- ML. is acronym for **M**achine **L**earning.
- A domain in computer science. A subdomain of {{ site.data.name.ai }}
- The object of study is algorthims that gives the computer:
  - the abilities to **learn**
  - the abilities to **make decision** on data and not on **explicit instructions**
- Is about:
  - Training a computer to **classify** New inputs
  - Learning a computer to **predict** new outputs based on existing inputs and outputs.  

## Machine Learning Model
- {{ site.data.name.aka }} Machine Learning algorithm.
- An algorithm used by an {{ site.data.name.ais }}.
- Uses data called **training data**.
- Allows an {{ site.data.name.ais }} to:
  - **Learn** and **improve** its performance over time. 
  - **Recognize** some patterns in data it receives ({{ site.data.name.ie }} training, test or unknow Data).
- This learning ({{ site.data.name.aka }} training) enables an {{ site.data.name.ais }} to use the patterns it has learned to:
  - Make **inferences** and **predictions**  on new, previously **unseen data**.
  - Automate some tasks.

# {{ site.data.name.class }} of Machine Learning Model
- supervised
  - the computer learns by making use of **labeled data**
  - each training data is labeled
    - Example: 
      - mail that is spam or not. 
      - The computer is trained with mail that we know they are spam are not.
- unsupervised
  - the computer learns by making use of **unlabeled data**
    - Example: 
      - categorize a book on basis of title and other infos.
      - the computer is trained with books that we ignore their category.
- enforcement
  - intelligent software agents take actions in 1 env and automatically try to improve its behavior
  - usually works with a system of rewards and punishements.

- Bias and Variance
- Evaluation Metrics.


# {{ site.data.name.process }}
- Learning phase
  1. An {{ site.data.name.ais }} receives **training data**. 
  1. It learns from them
  1. How : it identifies **patterns**.

- Test phase
  1. An {{ site.data.name.ais }} receives **test data**. 
  1. It make predictions or infers something on the data.
  1. How : it recognizes the **patterns** it has learned.
  1. we compare it prediction or inference with the expected one

- Recognition phase
  1. The {{ site.data.name.ais }} receives **unseen data**. 
  1. It make predictions or infers something on the data.
  1. How : it recognizes the **patterns** it has learned.
  1. we ises it prediction or inference in other system


# {{ site.data.name.todo }}
- model can be overfit or underfit to the training data
- datapoint
