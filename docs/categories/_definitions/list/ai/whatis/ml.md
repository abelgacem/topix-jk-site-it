# {{ site.data.name.definition }}
- Acronym for **M**achine **L**earning.
- a subdomain of {{ site.data.name.ai }}: the study of algorthims that gives the computer:
  - the abilities to **learn**
  - the abilities to **make decision** on data and **not explicit instructions**
- The core of ML is about
  - Training a computer to classify New inputs OR
  - Predict new outputs based on existing inputs and outputs.  

# Machine Learning model
- {{ site.data.name.aka }} Machine Learning algorithm.
- Consists of creating **Machine Learning algorthim/model** that are techiques, mechanisms used by an {{ site.data.name.ais }}.
- These **Machine Learning model** Uses data called **training data**.
- Allows an {{ site.data.name.ais }} to:
  - **Learn** and **improve** its performance over time. 
  - Recognize patterns.
- This learning ({{ site.data.name.aka }} training) enables an {{ site.data.name.ais }} to use the patterns it has learned to:
  - Make **inferences** and **predictions**  on new, previously **unseen data**.
  - Automate some tasks.

# {{ site.data.name.class }}
- supervised
  - the computer learns by making use of **labeled data**
  - each training data is labeled
    - Example: mail that is spam or not. We feed the computer with mail that we know are spam are not
- unsupervised
  - the computer learns by making use of **unlabeled data**
    - Example: categorize a book on basis of title and other infos
- enforcement
  - intelligent software agents take actions in 1 env and automatically try to improve its behavior
  - usually works with a system of rewards and punishement

# {{ site.data.name.process }}
Learning phase
1. An {{ site.data.name.ais }} receives **training data**. 
1. It learns from them
1. How : it identifies **patterns**.

Recognition phase
1. The {{ site.data.name.ais }} receives **unseen data**. 
1. It make predictions or infers something on the data.
1. How : by recognizing the **patterns** it has learned.

# {{ site.data.name.example }}
- Learn to predict if an email is a spam or not, by reading many different emails of these 2 types
  - this is a supervised email caus
