## Why domain need to define one language
Each domain 
  - has its object of study
  - questions itself and defines sophiticated models related to its object of study


The sophiticated the models, the greater the complexity, the more we are led to create some
- new words
- new categories
- new objects

This leads to create one new language dedicated/specific to the domain

This language is 
  - first created from the common language
  - then updated with characters, words, concepts, terms and expressions that are
    - new
    - extented, overdefined, overwrite, derived
